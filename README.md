GO Enrichment Analysis

One of the main uses of the GO is to perform enrichment analysis on gene sets. 

For example, given a set of genes that are up-regulated under certain conditions, an enrichment analysis will find which GO terms are over-represented (or under-represented) using annotations for that gene set.
